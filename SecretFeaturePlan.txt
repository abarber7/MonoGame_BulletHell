Implementing Secret Feature B: bullet type that pushes other bullets on collision

Classes needing change:
A new class would be needed for a concrete projectile type, within which the OnCollision method in particular would be overriden to specify that if the colliding sprite is another enemy projectile, force it to use the same movement pattern velocity as the new projectile type.
With the patterns already in place, nothing major or architectural needs to change. Projectile is an abstract class, as is MovementPattern, so adding new classes will be trivial, and collision detection was already being done for projectiles, they were just being told to ignore other projectiles.

Another new class might be added in order to showcase this feature, since the current movement patterns being used for projectiles don't have as much radial movement/variation as in the video.
